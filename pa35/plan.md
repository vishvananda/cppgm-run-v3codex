# PA35 Plan

## Stage Design and Spec Alignment

PA35 keeps source -> streaming preprocessing/post-tokenization -> integrated
syntax/semantics -> typed LowIR -> native ELF. Relevant `spec.md` requirements
are canonical identity and phase flow (§§2, 6), demand-owned specialization
(§4), and bounded, observable heavy-header work (§9). Retained syntax is shared;
concrete type, lookup, conversion, and lowering facts belong to their canonical
owner in the shared front end.

## Current Failure Map

PA35 is 105/124 with 19 failures. The complete set groups by shared owner:
trait readiness/specialization selection 3; retained overload/construction 5;
hosted vector-builtin lookup 2; reference and derived conversion 5;
parser/local/class lookup 2; and lowering/allocation 2.

## Active Checkpoint

**Reference-preserving specialization conversions.** Per `spec.md` §§2, 4-6,
alias-expanded specialization and call results must retain canonical reference
category, cv state, and base identity through implicit conversion. Data flows
specialization declarator -> canonical result type -> typed call/reference cast
-> conversion sequence. PA12 call/conversion analysis and PA19 specialization
typing own the boundary. Expected work is O(type depth + cached base-path probes)
per candidate, without rebuilding a specialization. Validate the two stream,
two shared-pointer, and regex conversion failures; positive/negative lvalue,
rvalue, and base-reference probes; 8/16 conversion shapes; PA35, PA1-34, and
audit.

## Performance Evidence

Eight/sixteen isolated alias-mediated recursive operator chains completed with a
2 MiB stack. Specialization requests were 88/176, cache hits 48/96, overload
candidates 56/112, deduction visits 48/96, and peak stage storage
575,702/1,144,384 bytes. Five-run median analysis was 2.89/5.45 ms and elapsed
time 4.17/7.66 ms, showing finite demand and near-linear scaling.
