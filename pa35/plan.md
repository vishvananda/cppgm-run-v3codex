# PA35 Plan

## Stage Design and Spec Alignment

PA35 keeps the source -> streaming preprocessing/post-tokenization -> integrated
syntax/semantics -> typed LowIR -> native ELF architecture. Relevant `spec.md`
requirements are canonical identity and phase flow (§2, §6), demand-owned
template specialization (§4), and bounded, observable heavy-header work (§9).
Retained syntax is shared, but concrete declaration, construction, lookup, and
access facts belong to the canonical specialization owner. The shared front end
owns all changes; no hosted-only route is introduced.

## Current Failure Map

PA35 is 91/119 with 28 failures. The complete set groups by first owner:
retained declaration/class lookup and access 3; expression/call/template demand
10; parser/local semantics 2; stream/heap stability 6; and native
object/register lowering 7.

## Active Checkpoint

**Native scalar aggregate transport.** Per `spec.md` §§6-9, a complete object
value must retain its typed LowIR shape while native adaptation classifies and
moves every ABI eightbyte without inventing a scalar or exhausting reactive
registers. Data flows typed aggregate load/call -> ABI value classification ->
legal register/stack fragments -> MIR locations and x86-64 encoding. PA15
lowering and PA31 native adaptation own the boundary. Expected work is O(type
fields + ABI eightbytes + LowIR instructions), with bounded per-instruction
register work. Validate the current `obj<1x1>`, `obj<8x8>`, multi-eightbyte,
missing-storage, and register-exhaustion failures; add size-boundary probes;
then run PA35, PA1-34, audit, and representative scaling cases.

## Performance Evidence

For 8/16-element explicit-id calls with a deduced trailing pack, lookup queries
were 66/82, template requests stayed 7/7, and peak semantic storage was
118,836/145,939 bytes. Five-run median semantic time was 0.762/0.781 ms; the
argument-aware partition remains linear and introduces no specialization fanout.
