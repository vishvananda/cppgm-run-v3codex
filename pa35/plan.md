# PA35 Plan

## Stage Design and Spec Alignment

PA35 keeps the source -> streaming preprocessing/post-tokenization -> integrated
syntax/semantics -> typed LowIR -> native ELF architecture. Relevant `spec.md`
requirements are canonical identity and phase flow (§2, §6), demand-owned
template specialization (§4), and bounded, observable heavy-header work (§9).
Retained syntax is shared, but concrete declaration, construction, lookup, and
access facts belong to the canonical specialization owner. The shared front end
owns all changes; no hosted-only route is introduced.

## Current Failure Map

PA35 is 98/120 with 22 failures. The complete set groups by first owner:
retained declaration/class lookup and access 3; expression/call/template demand
10; parser/local semantics 2; stream/heap stability 6; and native
object/register lowering 1.

## Active Checkpoint

**Growth-stable hosted token and syntax storage.** Per `spec.md` §§1, 2, 5,
8, and 9, token expansion and retained syntax must keep stable spelling and node
identity while temporary containers grow. Data flows include/macro tokens ->
post-token retained buffers and interned ranges -> syntax tag queries ->
template demand. `MacroProcessor` token queues and the interner/syntax arena own
the boundary: current regex cases corrupt a deque during `Drain`, while stream
cases fault in `InternedStringTable::InternRange` through `SyntaxArena::IsTag`.
Expected work is O(source bytes + expansion tokens) with amortized O(1) growth
and O(1) average intern lookup. Validate all six crash cases, token-burst and
deep-template 8/16 probes, PA35, PA1-34, and audit.

## Performance Evidence

For 8/16 forced-inline 16-byte object transfers, typed LowIR instructions were
140/268 and selected MIR instructions were 236/452. Five-run median native
lowering time was 0.458/0.763 ms and encoding time was 0.370/0.531 ms; work and
peak semantic storage (81,536/102,454 bytes) remained linear.
