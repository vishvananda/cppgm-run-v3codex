# PA17 Implementation Plan

## Stage Design and Spec Alignment

PA17 extends the PA16 typed semantic graph and LowIR. Canonical `TypeId`,
completed special-member facts, selected function identity, and typed actions
remain the phase boundary; lowering performs no lookup or text round trip.
Class completion owns copy/move/assignment facts, PA12 owns selection and
demand, and PA15-PA17 materialize into destination storage or ABI result slots.
This follows `spec.md` sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9: monotonic demand,
O(1)-average fact access, O(candidate count) selection, O(subobject count)
synthesis, and O(emitted IR) lowering.

## Current Failure Map

Current result: **136/231**, up from the **124/231** checkpoint baseline. The
non-overlapping remaining-failure map is:

| Failures | Shared behavior | Primary owner |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 24 | temporary lifetime and cleanup across control flow | PA12 lifetime facts + PA16 lowering |
| 16 | array allocation/deletion and union active-member lifetime | PA12 object actions + PA16 lifetime lowering |
| 21 | residual operators, conversions, lookup, and ref qualification | PA12 calls/operator resolution |
| 32 | class-value construction, initialization, copy/move, and ABI shapes | PA12 initialization + PA15-PA17 lowering |
| 2 | residual namespace/control interactions | PA12 lookup and statement analysis |

## Active Checkpoint

**Active: array allocation/deallocation typed actions.** Apply `spec.md`
sections 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 at the PA12 object-action boundary. PA12 will retain
the selected allocator/deallocator, converted extent, element type and stride,
cookie requirement, and element constructor/destructor actions; PA16 lowering
will consume those facts to form explicit forward construction and reverse
destruction loops without lookup or name reconstruction. Semantic work is
O(actual candidates + initializer clauses), retained state is O(1) per array
expression, emitted control flow is O(1), and runtime work is O(element count).
Validate the scalar and class array-new/delete cluster, then full PA17, through
PA16, audit, and extent/candidate scaling. Union active-member lifetime remains
a separate later boundary.

## Performance Evidence

- Same-name declaration and selected-call probes scale proportionally from
  64/128/256 declarations; medians were 1.269/2.401/4.830 ms and
  2.920/5.944/11.815 ms respectively, with doubling counters and storage.
- Direct-transfer probes emit constant-count `copyobj` operations; a 24-byte
  indirect result remains one width-annotated instruction rather than a loop.
- Synthesized assignment at 32/64/128 members recorded 96/192/384 fact and
  subobject visits and 184/344/664 instructions.
- Synthesized construction at 32/64/128 members recorded 160/320/640 fact
  lookups, 161/321/641 subobject visits, and 271/527/1,039 instructions.
  Five-run semantic medians were 0.216/0.281/0.405 ms, confirming linear work.
- Conversion indexes at 32/64/128 candidates recorded 42/74/138 overload
  visits and 71/135/263 conversion checks. Five-run semantic medians were
  0.999/1.625/3.165 ms, proportional to the indexed candidate set.
- Built-in comparison over inherited conversion indexes at 32/64/128 entries
  recorded 67/131/259 overload visits and 134/262/518 conversion checks;
  five-run semantic medians were 0.948/1.800/3.658 ms and semantic peak storage
  was 268,397/532,493/1,060,770 bytes, proportional to the indexed input.
- Scalar `new` with 16/32/64 unrelated placement overloads recorded 17/33/65
  overload visits, a fixed 4 conversion checks after arity filtering, and
  19,401/36,137/69,609 typed bytes. Five-run semantic medians were
  0.504/0.938/1.723 ms, proportional to the actual candidate set.
