# PA17 Implementation Plan

## Stage Design and Spec Alignment

PA17 extends the PA16 typed semantic graph and LowIR. Canonical `TypeId`,
completed special-member facts, selected function identity, and typed actions
remain the phase boundary; lowering performs no lookup or text round trip.
Class completion owns copy/move/assignment facts, PA12 owns selection and
demand, and PA15-PA17 materialize into destination storage or ABI result slots.
This follows `spec.md` sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9: monotonic demand,
O(1)-average fact access, O(candidate count) selection, O(subobject count)
synthesis, and O(emitted IR) lowering.

## Current Failure Map

Current result: **110/231**, up from the **97/231** checkpoint baseline. The
non-overlapping remaining-failure map is:

| Failures | Shared behavior | Primary owner |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 23 | residual class-value construction/ABI/initialization shapes | PA12 initialization + PA15-PA17 lowering |
| 34 | ADL, built-in/overloaded operators, and residual conversion sequences | PA12 calls/operator resolution |
| 34 | scalar/class allocation, deletion, arrays, and unions | PA12 object actions + PA16 lifetime lowering |
| 22 | temporary lifetime and cleanup across control flow | PA12 lifetime facts + PA16 lowering |
| 2 | ref-qualified class-value cross-cases | PA12 selection + PA16 lowering |
| 6 | residual initialization/lowering interactions | mixed owners after the above boundaries |

## Active Checkpoint

**Next: built-in operator candidates after class conversion.** Reuse the
completed per-class conversion index and `CallConversionFact` to form the
standard built-in unary, arithmetic, pointer, comparison, logical, subscript,
and compound-assignment candidates required by `spec.md` sections 3, 6, and 9.
PA12 must retain selected operand conversions and result type before lowering;
PA15-PA17 consume only typed operands. Expected work remains O(actual
conversion functions + built-in candidate forms), with no scope-wide scan.
Validate the built-in conversion/operator cluster, full PA17, through PA16,
file audit, and candidate-count scaling.

## Performance Evidence

- Same-name declaration and selected-call probes scale proportionally from
  64/128/256 declarations; medians were 1.269/2.401/4.830 ms and
  2.920/5.944/11.815 ms respectively, with doubling counters and storage.
- Direct-transfer probes emit constant-count `copyobj` operations; a 24-byte
  indirect result remains one width-annotated instruction rather than a loop.
- Synthesized assignment at 32/64/128 members recorded 96/192/384 fact and
  subobject visits and 184/344/664 instructions.
- Synthesized construction at 32/64/128 members recorded 160/320/640 fact
  lookups, 161/321/641 subobject visits, and 271/527/1,039 instructions.
  Five-run semantic medians were 0.216/0.281/0.405 ms, confirming linear work.
- Conversion indexes at 32/64/128 candidates recorded 42/74/138 overload
  visits and 71/135/263 conversion checks. Five-run semantic medians were
  0.999/1.625/3.165 ms, proportional to the indexed candidate set.

## Completed Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Result | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ref-qualified member identity and selection | 42/228 -> 57/231 | Focused 15/15; through PA16; audit and proportional probes pass |
| Direct trivial class-value transfer and ABI | 57/231 -> 68/231 | Exact-copy focus; through PA16; constant-count transfer probes and audit pass |
| Synthesized copy/move assignment | 68/231 -> 79/231 | Implicit/defaulted/deleted focus; through PA16; linear probes and audit pass |
| Synthesized copy/move construction and materialization | 79/231 -> 97/231 | Deleted/defaulted/move-only and call/return focus; named return-slot reuse; through PA16 1,436/1,436; linear probes and audit pass |
| Indexed conversion functions and retained selection | 97/231 -> 110/231 | Implicit/explicit, inherited, ref-qualified, second-rank, alias-ID, and qualified-definition focus 10/10; through PA16 1,436/1,436; linear probes and audit pass |
